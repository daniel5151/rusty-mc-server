# rusty-mc-server

A (incredibly basic) Minecraft server written in Rust.

## What Works

Err, almost nothing at the moment!

Pinging the server works, but that's about it!

## What's the Plan?

Gradually build out more and more of the protocol, as outlined on https://wiki.vg/Protocol.

The end goal isn't to make a replacement for the standard Minecraft server.jar. That would take waaaay too long, and isn't something I even have interest in doing.

This project is mainly about messing around with network programming a bit, and seeing if I can implement enough of the minecraft server protocol to get a player in-game, and send them some chunk data.
